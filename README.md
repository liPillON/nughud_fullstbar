# nughud_fullstbar

a fullscreen variant of the classic DOOM stbar, powered by Nugget Doom


![README](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liPillON/nughud_fullstbar/main/README.png)


## Features:
- the classic Doom statusbar, now available in fullscreen mode
- weapon slots 8 & 9 are integrated in the stock arms panel
- adjusted position for mapname/time/stats widget
- vanilla-compatible (320x200) pwad-provided statusbars are fully supported


## Limitations:
- this is a singleplayer-only HUD, since NUGHUD does not support displaying the FRAGS and MUGSHOT widgets both in the same place simultaneously
- widescreen-compatible (wider than 320 pixels) statusbars lumps negate the effect of this mod
